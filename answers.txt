1. Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel.

SELECT h1.name
FROM Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2, Friend f
WHERE h1.ID = f.ID1
AND h2.ID = f.ID2
AND h2.name = 'Gabriel';

2. Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades.

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT ID1 FROM Likes)
AND ID NOT IN (SELECT ID2 FROM Likes);

3. (*) Find the name and grade of all students who are liked by more than one other student.

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID2
FROM Likes
GROUP BY ID2
HAVING COUNT(ID1) > 1);

4. (*) For every student who likes someone 2 or more grades younger than themselves, return that studentâ€™s name and grade, and the name and grade of the student they like.

SELECT a.name, a.grade, b.name, b.grade
FROM Highschooler a, Highschooler b, Likes
WHERE ID1 = a.ID
AND ID2 = b.ID
AND b.grade <= (a.grade - 2);

8. (**) What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)

SELECT AVG(num)
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS num 
FROM Friend
GROUP BY ID2) count;
